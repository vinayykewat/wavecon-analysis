Vinay sahani!
I saw the response from Mathew and you did a good job there. As a next step, you will be creating a dashboard and I want to give you some quick tips.

Ensure that the dashboard you are creating meets Mathew’s requirements.
Create a DAX metrics list so that you have clarity before building the dashboard.
Create documentation for Mathew so that they won’t have issues in understanding the dashboard.
I have attached a sample DAX metrics list and sample documentation from previous projects that should help guide you in the right direction. Study these resources and use them as a reference throughout your work.

In case you need help, feel free to contact your seniors.

Best regards,
Hem
Head of Data Analytics
